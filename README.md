AttendU App Project


Introduction:
AttendU is an app that lets students record their attendance and also view their grades and other info regarding their schoolwork such as timetables and grades. We plan to use ionic to develop the app and possibly using a database to store the student information.

Features:
Login feature – student’s login to their account and can view their information.
Attendance – Users will be able to record attendance with a code issued by the teacher or possibly the use of a beacon.
Database – Users can view their attendance records and grades through the database.
Admin access – any admin can login and edit the students’ details.

Progress update 8/2/18:
Thought about the layout of the app, user logs into the class when they attend. The teacher will issue out a code where the student can check in their attendance. Decided that we will be using ionic to develop the application.

Progress update 15/2/18:
We have a basic idea on the layout of the app as seen below. The user will input their login information for the current class and the student will be brought to the home page, where they can view information on their grades/attendance.
